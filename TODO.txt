- tune communication rate with significance of differences with neighbors 
- average with neighbors to weighted sum: rely on neighbors when differences are high
- explain why swarm is behaving in a certain way 
- Attract B * (1-C) instead of 1-C
- Redefine Belief error calculation 
 + image processing diff |screen – large_resolution(belief_map)|
- Add human interface
 + Human belief can be manipulated too
- Trust:
 + Trust Level = |B_operator – B_swarm|
 + Trust = 1/speed; 1/communication_rate
 + Higher Trust -> exploitation
 + Lower Trust -> exploration 
 + Voting mechanism?
- 1024 robots:
 + Goal: performance decreases but works
